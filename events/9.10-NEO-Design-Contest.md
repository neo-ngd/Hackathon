> *Read this page in other languages: [中文版](9.10-NEO-创意设计大赛章程.md)*

## Background

NEO, a world renowned blockchain project, has been on the fast track of development in recent years, making considerable breakthroughs in development and community expansion. Given that the community has placed high expectation on our branding and promotional effect, we are planning on a creative design contest – NEO Creative Design Contest to put heads together with the purpose of diversifying the visual elements and enhancing the visual effect of our brand. By holding the contest, we also hope to find more talented designers willing to join NEO community to contribute.

**About NEO:**

As a non-profit community-driven blockchain project, NEO uses blockchain technology and digital identity to digitalize assets and automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts. Using a distributed network, it aims to create a “Smart Economy”.

NEO was founded in 2014 and was open sourced on GitHub in June 2015. NEO believes that community development is its top priority. NEO has a huge developer community around the world who continuously contribute to NEO ecosystem development. Millions of community members are active on Reddit, Discord, Github and Twitter. (find more details at http://neo.org)

## Theme

Revolving around the theme “Smart Economy”, NEO Creative Design Contest will include two tracks of contest: NEO website design and NEO icon design.

#### NEO Website design

NEO website plays an essential role of branding and information display and is deemed as the main source of information by our followers. Whether the design fits aesthetical standard and whether it follows interactive and operational logics leave an immediate impression on the visitors. To adapt our website to the expectations of users in the project’s fast growing period, we are now collecting NEO website designs.

An ideal design should be aesthetically pleasing, accommodating both the designing elements and the technology concept of NEO. The design is required to follow interactive logics and our community operations model.

#### NEO Icon Design

NEO is an original public chain project. Many of its concepts are original and self-defined, representing essential parts of the ecosystem. To explain and promote these concepts to the public, we are now collecting icons related to NEO ecosystem.

The design should demonstrate the features and roles of each concept, fits in harmony with the overall visual style of NEO and also reflects the design philosophy of NEO. Competitors are required to choose at least 5 out of the 10 concepts given below. See detailed descriptions on the NEO whitepaper (http://docs.neo.org/zh-cn/whitepaper.html).

NEO Gas / NEO Asset / NEO  Contract / NEO VM / NEO DevPack / NEO ID / NEO FS / NEO X / NEO QS / NEO message
