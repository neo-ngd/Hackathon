##### Competition Rules   

1. All code projects should use the [MIT license](https://github.com/neo-ngd/Hackathon/blob/master/LICENSE).
2. Teams can use any platform or programing language to develop the system.
3. There is no maximum or minimum team size.
4. Organizers, judges, or sponsors are not allowed to participate or join a team.
5. All members of the team should be present during the day of the event, `Oct 27th`, as we believe it's integral to community development and working cooperatively. Leaving the venue for a duration to hack elsewhere is also allowed.
6. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others. Judges can help teams with basic questions, but we strongly recommend team should think and solve problems independently.

9. We are holding this challenge at a very high regard, thus if there are no teams which have shown exemplary work, then the grand prize may be ommitted and left vacant.

11. This is a competition for the community, so please follow the rules and respect competing teams.

##### Forming Teams

It’s highly recommended that challengers can organize a team to participate in this competition. Teams with diverse backgrounds are suggested. If you start off alone and want to join a team, please join [NEO’s discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/umsfhqs) to coordinate and communicate with others interested.

##### Judging Factors

The score will be judged by:

- **Functionality**: Did your project fulfill all of the criteria show on the table above? How could you try to take what is required and add onto it to make it stand out?
- **Ease to Use**: Is the User-experience welcoming and not awfully complicated to new and concurrent users of the platform? Try to let other test for you to see if the system you built is intuitive.
- **Stability**: Have you tested the reliability and amount of downtime for the site? We are looking for a system that can be consistent and relay information to user without many bugs.
- **Website Performance**: How much resource does the website take to run, short and long term? We encourage developers to optimize the platform in hopes to see a platform that won't hinder the user's inputs and experience as a whole.
- **Interface Design**: Does the design of the platform not only reflect the themes of NEO's ecosystem but also have a look that can differentiate it from the others? Fluid and modern designs could make the website feel more approachable.
